# THE SCENE IS DEAD, portable

This is a portable version of THE SCENE IS DEAD demo released by Razor 1911 at Revision 2012.

## Building
Only GLFW and OpenGL is required. Once you met the requirements, run `make`.
Untested on *BSD and others, possibly compiles on Windows with MingW but at that point you should just run the original 64k version.

## To-do list (for complete portability)
- [ ] Port to OpenGL ES 2.0
- [ ] Port to WASM

**DISCLAIMER: While the original demo is 64k, this portable version IS NOT 64K. It would be nice if it was.**
